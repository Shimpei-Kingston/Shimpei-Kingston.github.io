Introduction

As a Japanese designer who works for fashion brands, I always look for inspiration from 90’s and early 00’s Japanese “Ura-Harajuku”, also known as “Ura-hara” subculture. Harajuku is a small area in Shibuya, Tokyo where many fashion brands have opened stores. Ura is defined as the backstreets, that contrasts the highstreets. In addition, “Ura-hara” represents this vast subculture scene that was born in the backstreets of Harajuku. 
I believe that fashion and graphics produced throughout this subculture were more imaginative and playful than what is being produced now. “Ura-hara” popularity at the time was tremendous. It was unique and had an enthusiastic community around the world. I am also intrigued by high quality products and those that evidence detailed design, as well as those that are still wearable and casual, but have hidden details. Since I moved to London, it surprised me when young British people were taking inspiration from Japanese subculture. I could have imagined if people were being inspired by Japanese stereotypes, such as, cars and food, however it surprised me to see people being inspired by Japanese art, fashion and photography including “Ura-hara”. 
I would like to discuss why “Ura-hara” has been influencing people and exactly how this subculture from the backstreets of Harajuku has gained its reputation. Additionally, I would like to explore why this “Ura-hara” subculture is regaining popularity and filtering back into the fashion industry in the present day, as well as uncover what the future of this subculture is. 


Chapter 1 - Defining “Ura-harajuku”

Firstly, I would like to discuss what “Ura-Hara” is in terms of style, fashion, and graphics. Also, where exactly “Ura-harajuku” is. I am going to explore why it became very popular and what elements of “Ura-hara” are attracting people around the world. Harajuku is a smaller district within Shibuya, Tokyo, where lined up with many trendy fashion stores, used clothing stores, and fast food outlets. It is known internationally as a center of Japanese fashion and youth culture. “Ura-Harajuku” refers even smaller district of Harajuku that tucked away behind the highstreets of Harajuku. An area of approximately four-square blocks including Harajuku Street and Jingumae 3 chome. Therefore, there is no place called “Ura-Harajuku" on the map.
Fig.2 “Ura-hara” map (Qkaku, 2022)
“Ura-Harajuku” also contrasts with the highstreets of Harajuku that contains larger international chain fashion brands and high-end luxury brands, spreading to Omotesand. Omote means “top” or “above”. “Ura-hara” was the alter-ego of Harajuku’s glitzy atmosphere. It was inverted, almost monochromatic and hidden. “Ura-Harajuku” mostly lined up with smaller independent shops, such as youth owned independent clothing or sneaker stores, cafes, and art galleries all with a distinct style. “Ura-hara”, abbreviation for Ura-Harajuku, literally means the hidden or the back street of Harajuku. However, we are unsure of who started using this word. There is no clear definition of “Ura-hara”. Therefore, some believe that “Ura-hara” was an antithesis of the highstreets of Harajuku, that is believed to be the center of Japanese fashion. “Ura-hara” is the opposite of the market surrounding mass-produced fashion brands and high-end luxury brands and is a rebellion on Harajuku, as it signified the change in Japanese fashion at that time and intended to invert what Harajuku was. If this analysis is right, it could be “Ura-hara” kei brands even if shops are not exactly located in Ura-hara area. According to Joe Strummer from The Clash, “Punk rock isn't something you grow out of. Punk rock is an attitude, and the essence of that attitude is 'give us some truth”. With this in mind, “Ura-hara” does not mean something has to be from the “Ura-hara” area, it is an attitude. “Ura-hara” was a case of, ‘if you know, you know’. It was a hidden paradise for like-minded youth to come together, which helped the community and culture around them grow naturally and vastly. Although it is difficult to define the style and characteristics of the “Ura-hara” community, it can however be narrowed down to two identifiers.  
・Wearing street wear clothing, It was mainly for men, with casual loose coordinate and baggy look, such as sports style, logos or graphics printed or embroidered on hoodie, thick denim items.  
・Influenced by music subculture. It was heavily influenced by punk culture, reggae, hip hop, and skater style. Although, there is no problem to say “Ura-hara” without using kei. “Ura-hara” style categorised as “Ura-hara kei” in Japan. Kei is type or genre in Japanese. Especially in music genre, it seems that “kei" tends to be added.

Therefore, it is clear that “Ura-hara” style tends to have influences in music subculture. Soon after “Ebisu-kei” was born around Ebisu area that appears to be having stronger music influences and more street wear look. “Ebisu-kei” is also recognized as a part of “Ura-hara” as it was developed from Ura-hara”.  
There was also a clear gender split between the highstreets of Harajuku and the backstreets of Harajuku when “Ura-hara” was born. “Ura-hara” was domained by male designers and their exclusively male fashion market, that rejected the commercialisation of the 1980s fashion scene and mass-produced styles influenced by western culture. “Ura-hara” emerged with the efforts of Hiroshi Fujiwara who designed for numerous brands: Bape (A Bathing Ape) and Undercover, which created a male interest in fashion and music, including hip-hop, graffiti, and skater culture. The “Ura-hara” movement is a mixture of all these subcultures. 
In addition to this, ‘he parlayed this network of contacts into a considerable sphere of influence over Tokyo’s street culture in the late 1980s. With his attenuated radar picking up the latest trends and information, Fujiwara became Tokyo’s go-to authority on youth culture, garnering the attention of all media watchers.’ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) It is undoubtable that to Tokyo’s youth, who were following streetwear culture, Hiroshi Fujuwara was an icon that they would look up to. Fujuwara was exposed and influenced to numerous Western subcultures that has driven him to ‘be a successful entrepreneur’ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Because of his influence at the center of Harajuku, Fujiwara built the platform for numerous other designers to follow, thus he set into a form of what would become the “Ura-hara” movement. In addition to this, “Ura-hara” could not have such a rapid growth movement without pioneers who were part of young Hiroshi Fujiwara followers. Two of these were Jun Takahashi known as Jonio and Tomoaki Nagao known as NIGO, who met at Bunka fashion college in Tokyo. They built a friendship with a shared interest in fashion and music which led to the opening of store NOWHERE in 1993. 
Fig.4 Store NOWHERE, NIGO, Hiroshi Fujiwara, (NIGO), Jun Takahashi (Alistair,2017)
NOWHERE was split in two sections, ‘one half of the shop was for Nigo's Bape graphic shirts, while the other housed Jun's stock. the store also had vintage and deadstock items from America. NOWHERE also carried pieces designed by graphic designer Sk8thing, and WTAPS’ Tetsu Nishiyama.’ (Alistair,2017) It was located in the center of the “Ura-hara” community. The “Ura-hara” movement successfully became recognised with opening of NOWHERE along the backstreets of Harajuku. Soon after, Nigo launched his own brand, A Bathing Ape with the support of graphic designer Sk8Thing to take advantage of the store’s popularity. “This was the mentality at the time when, shortly before the internet, people knew about the shop from word-of-mouth and recommendation alone.” (HB team,2014) It was not very long before more stores like NOWHERE or the official A Bathing Ape store began to open up. “Shinsuke Takizawa’s passion for Americana and a “rebel”-like way of thinking lead to the start of NEIGHBORHOOD, a brand named after his affiliation and respect towards the physical “neighborhood” of Urahara.” (HB team,2014) Shinsuke’s designs were at that time very radical, referencing motorcycle culture and American heavy metal that Japanese youth had not been exposed to. “Rocker-slash-designer Nobuhiko Kitamura soon after opened HYSTERIC GLAMOUR, a brand devoted to fans of ’70s rock bands and films you’d find of the grindhouse/Russ Meyer variety. Creative designer SK8THING was mixed into the scene as well, providing mind-blowing graphic designs for A Bathing Ape, punk/toy brand BOUNTY HUNTER and many more. “ (HB team,2014)
The creativity in “Ura-hara” simply could not be stopped, came along with brands like Wtaps, Visvim, Hectic. Styles and statements all with their own unique taste and message began to reach the streets, and youth in the scene were obsessed with it. “Typical of Tokyo, most of streets in this area were narrow, unnamed, curving, winding, end abruptly, or cross each other in oddly formed intersections, giving shops and buildings a feeling of being tucked away and below the radar.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) This physical reality helped strengthen the idea of doing something advanced and in a different way. “The fact that the Ura-hara designers at first couldn’t afford to advertise like established brands was used to their advantage, with A Bathing Ape and Under Cover “leaking” information to the media, often to the same magazines in which these designers had regular columns. The clothes were made in limited editions, which further added to their allure. “ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) It is unclear whether the designers intentionally limited availability of clothes in order to create a rush or not, however, their guerrilla-marketing strategy led to success. “To be a part of it and own one of these limited articles of clothing, kids had to have their ear to the ground to learn about new items in time. Then they would wait in line before the shops opened to get their hands on a new design.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) “Ura-hara” designers were seen as mysterious, and their clothes were seen as an entry to the lifestyle that emerged from a mixture of hip hop, punk, skater, and biker subcultures. This street based lifestyle was authentic “Ura-hara” style, which young designers developed by taking elements of Western subculture and mixing and combining them with their own original creativity.

Chapter 2 - How “Ura-hara” gained popularity

Secondly, I would like to discuss how this subculture arose. From western subculture influences on Japanese designers, how exactly “Ura-hara” gained its reputation and authenticity as a Japanese subculture. I am going to explore the history of Harajuku before the “Ura-hara” movement appeared and will discuss its emergence.
Whilst the street wear community in downtown of New York was getting bigger with brands such as Supreme and Stussy, something was emerging in an area of Harajuku, Japan, known as “Ura-hara”. “Some shops took inspiration from the West, pulling their newfound interest from America or the UK and importing the sportswear they found from subcultures of hip-hop and punk. This ultimately brought an influx of new ideas and creativity that Japan had never yet seen.” (HB team,2014) It is believed that vintage stores like “A Store Robot” or “Vintage King” were the roots of “Ura-hara” movement. These stores encouraged newfound approach to western subcultures and provided enough content to develop further creativity. It was a combination between domestic product and the understanding of foreign and domestic subculture. For example, Nigo was referencing in American hip-hop music and culture. Shinsuke Takizawa was influenced by American heavy metal and motorcycle culture. Nobuhiko Kitamura took inspirations from 1970s rock bands and films.
“The youth soaked up everything like a sponge, and every new piece they bought helped disseminate it across their peers in schools, on the streets, and at the hangout spots until eventually the brands became the topic of strong word-of-mouth advertising, with kids all across Tokyo asking where they found each other’s T-shirts or accessories.” (HB team,2014)
By cross-fertilization of domestic and foreign subculture, “Ura-hara” movement was able to create something that had not yet been exposed to Japanese youth, which explains their popularity at the time. This cross-fertilization movement originally began soon after the world war 2, when Harajuku was the area of U.S. forces residences and shops catering to the officers and their families. The transformation of Harajuku into the center of fashion district known as “Ura-hara” began when ‘Japanese youths flocked to the area to see Western products and be exposed to Western culture. By the 1960s the neighborhood had become an established meeting ground for Japanese youths, fostering commercial development in the area.’ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Residences for U.S. forces officers and their families, “Washington Heights” were built in empty land of Harajuku, south of the Meiji-jingu where previously had been used for military drills. “Washington Heights” and American resident that lived there brought western lifestyle and culture to the surrounding area which developed the area to a sophisticated international district that had never existed in Japan. At that time, most of Japanese people had no experience with western culture, fashions, or lifestyles. However Japanese youth from Harajuku who were living in close to American residents in “Washington Heights” and surrounding areas, were ahead of these influences and their curiosity for the Westerners' cool styles stimulated their dreams and ambitions which created the roots for the Harajuku of today. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, a new Japanese generation experienced the country growing from the post-war period to the rapid economic growth period which led to the second largest economy in the world by the 1980s. This newborn generation was also exposed to the emergence of youth culture both in the west and Japan distinguished by the social revolution and anxiety on the edge of an uncertain future, highlighted by the student activism, Woodstock, and the anti-Vietnam war movement. 
In 1958, “Central Apartments” was built in Harajuku which was soon to be occupied by the residence and working spaces of fashion designers, models, photographers, and graphic designers. “The Central Apartments complex served as a nexus of creativity in the late 1960s to 1970s. It was home to many of the key players who would later emerge as major forces in Japanese fashion, design, art, photography, music and new advertising.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) They hung out at “Café Leon”, opened on the ground floor. Japan’s first boutique, “Mademoiselle Non Non”, opened on the first floor of “Central Apartments” in 1964. Milk opened right next door in 1970. A distinct Harajuku atmosphere was emerged as the first boutiques, late-night restaurants, and cafes opened in the area. It established a place for Japanese youth to come together and business growth in the area. As a result of this development, Harajuku stepped even further forward to become a modern and international district. 
In 1964, the Summer Olympics took place in Tokyo. The main arena was built next to the ex-military drill field and where “Washington Heights” was built before, which became the Olympic Village. After the Olympics, Japanese youth who hung out in Harajuku called “Harajuku-zoku” (Harajuku tribe) started developing a unique taste and style that distinguished them from groups in Tokyo's other areas. “The area, because of the density of like-minded creators working there, became known as the place to be for those seeking a shortcut to the fashion world. Clothing designers, models, stylists, hair and makeup artists, and anyone else who wanted to become part of Japan's fashion industry flocked to Harajuku. “ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Harajuku offered opportunity found nowhere in Tokyo. Hence It was attracting for young men and women. 
The first wave of young designers who gathered in Harajuku with a desire to build up something new emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. They had a potential for a new fashion industry, worked from scratch and explored a brand-new business model. “Soon these small efforts grew into major apparel companies now known as "DC" (Designer Character) brands.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Such as Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garcons. 
Ryuko Tsushin, one of the leading Japanese fashion magazines was recognised as a popular manual at the time, titled "How to succeed in the fashion business," which advised young designers to rent a small space in an affordable apartment block in the backstreets of Harajuku. Young designer’s collections were mostly copies of western designs, which in fact were in high demand in the Japanese domestic market. The collections would be sold wholesale to small independent stores. Another route available for young designers was renting cheap retail space in Takeshitadori and opening their own retail stores. A strategy considered here was a good method for selling independent designer’s clothes. Selling it directly to consumers, designers were able to see the items that sold well and produce more if they wanted to. They might earn a profit in several years, which they might be able to buy editorial coverage in a fashion magazine. Once they became known to consumers through the advertisement in magazines, designers could have a page for talking about their history and background to promote the designs further, which would help increasing sales. At this point, a designer could feel that their brand reached to the fashion market. The next step would be to open a concession in a department store with numerous fashion brand tenants like “Laforet” or open a store on the highstreets of Harajuku. This helped designers to establish a company and grow a business, expanding distribution throughout the country. This is the most common direction that was taken by Japanese designers who were seeking success in the fashion industry. 
In the 1960s and 1970s property values in Harajuku were cheaper than in the surrounding area, it therefore allowed young designers to combine their work and sales in one location which helped them to maintain a standard of creativity otherwise unavailable to them. Renting affordable offices with the support of a handful of staff. This small scale of production with limited stocks and budget allowed the designers to make their production exclusive. Since the late 1960s, brands such as Kansai Yamamoto, Comme des Garcons, and Yohji Yamamoto's Y's all started out from Harajuku in this direction. In 1978, department store “Laforet” quickly became the core of the Japanese fashion scene and the platform for newborn fashion businesses. As Japan entered its period of rapid economic growth during the 1980s, people started spending more money on consumer products. This healthy consumer economy was crucial to the development of the next generation of designers and brands who arguably have an understanding of trends and marketing. “The Harajuku creators of the 1980s and 1990s, like their predecessors from the previous decade, continued the tradition of inventing new business paradigms alongside their similarly new designs.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) The next generation continued with their new ideas and designs to produce further creativity. 
Although Japanese culture tends to pay homage to tradition, Harajuku fashion scene has been the antithesis. It has been known as a popular spot for like-minded youth to come together and chase after the latest trends. Since Harajuku is the origin as a fashion district, some would say that it is perhaps one of the reasons that Harajuku is strongly linked with the youth subculture. When Japan's rapid economic growth ended with a burst in the early 1990s, it destroyed many of values and beliefs that had become standard to Japanese identity. Big business no longer dominated the market, it was seen as risky as small independent business, thus it evened the field out for all new designers and encouraged start-ups with a possibility. “Suddenly, anyone could be a contender.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) This opportunity happened together with a reaction in multiple underground subculture scenes similar to the Harajuku fashion scenes that had been born during booming times. It turned the first wave of development of Japan's street fashion into something easily digested and replicated in the wider popular culture. “The street nature of Harajuku styles, and the way in which design develops here - more to do with editing and remixing than with setting down new tracks - also contribute to the ephemerality of Harajuku street style. Each look is an amalgam of many other styles, strategies, incidents, and whims.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008)
 Harajuku’s compactness and the originality of the area has initiated microtrends to increase in popularity and then die out with a rapid pace, causing trends to constantly cycle. Although, Japanese culture places emphasis on maintaining a connection to the past, there is an equivalent drive toward constant change to find the latest thing and the next upcoming trend. It is almost impossible to try tracking and defining styles that evolve at such a rapid pace.
What has established in Harajuku has completely changed what had been the fashion industry’s business practices and marketing strategies. “Traditional couture is preoccupied with structure, superlative craftsmanship, and exquisite materials, used in ways that create new forms: a type of wearable architecture. “ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) On the other hand, street fashion is entirely about pop culture. T-shirts, denim, and ready-made clothes are ‘staples of this wardrobe.’ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Until recently, there was a clear contrast between couture, pret-a-porter, sportswear, and street fashion. “While there is evidence of an increasing cross-pollination in all sectors, the extent of intermingling occurred in “Ura-hara” is remarkable.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) All the developments of the recent “Ura-hara” movement, street fashion, guerrilla marketing, and limited production model, along with the emergence of individual designers created an environment in which Japanese youth have been able to absorb Western styles and create something unique and identifiable to Japan. “Entrepreneurial, media-savvy, creative, and determined, they represent a young, vital energy in Japanese society that harks back to the earlier achievements of the postwar generation. “ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Japanese youth culture has always evolved in relationship to the past, with Japanese youth seeking ‘a new identity separate from the standard social norms.’ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) In the middle of 1990s, emergence of Japanese hip-hop, punk, and dance music coincided with the impulses of street fashion, established a brand-new, powerful youth subculture in Tokyo. This can also be seen as a confidence among young Japanese designers encouraged by the rich consumer environment. “There were Japanese designers, Japanese stores, Japanese magazines, an entire Japanese market.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008)
There was a clear transition from copying the Western subculture to creating made in Japan - authentic Japanese subculture. Japanese youth were absorbing Western styles and creating their own subculture. By just like how hip hop musicians are including an element of other musician’s song that is already produced in the past in your composition. It is called ‘sampling’ (Hannah,2020) in Hip hop culture and ‘the sample can be anything that you’ve ‘sampled’ from another track; a rhythm, a melody, a beat, vocals or speech, which you then manipulate, edit, chop up or loop to fit creatively within your work’ (Hannah,2020) Although, there were economic fluctuation and the consumer culture behind the development, by sampling elements of Western subculture to develop something new, “Ura-hara” designers were able to blend domestic and foreign subculture to establish an authentic Japanese subculture. This allowed “Ura-hara” to gain its reputation and authenticity as a distinctive Japanese coterie.

Chapter 3 - How the Ura-hara subculture re-emerged and is circulating in the present day

I have been frequently asked by British fashion brands, as a Japanese designer, to bring ideas. One of these brand’s references is often a fashion brand or a clothing piece from the “Ura-hara”. It makes me wonder why it has been attracting people around the world even though “Ura-hara” started decline before 2010. Western creators are now being influenced by the “Ura-hara” movement. A minority of them are accused of appropriating Japan’s “Ura-hara” subculture. However, the “Ura-hara” subculture itself was established by taking inspiration from Western subculture and developing it with domestic culture and lifestyle. Western influenced “Ura-hara” subculture is now influencing Western creators. I would like to discuss how the “Ura-hara” subculture is regaining popularity and filtering back into the fashion industry in the present day, as well as its influence in Western countries. 
In addition to this, my Japanese friend and I organised a pop up store called “Boy Next Door” at Peckham London, in November 2022. We sold vintage clothes and exhibited printed media such as photo books and magazines from the 1990s to the early 2000s. We wanted people to experience authentic Japanese culture at the pop up; why it has been influencing people and how exactly did this subculture from the backstreets of Harajuku gain its reputation through the clothes and printed media we had collected. I would like to explore the reaction we gained from the London youth and creatives who attended this pop up. It is my personal observation of how the “Ura-hara” subculture is filtering back into the present day as well as its influence in Western countries.
In Harajuku, which has come to symbolize street fashion culture, ‘there is the "street reality’ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) of what is actually being worn and why, and what “Ura-hara” represents. What represents “Ura-hara” fashion is clearly expressed in the outfit of these youth. “Ura-hara” fashion is both a form of self-expression and a tool to communicate a specific identity as a community mostly through the style. “And for the kids shopping in “Ura-hara”, its energy and history offer the potential for personal style and expression.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Ura-Harajuku" is not just a physical location, it is an environment for those youth who gathered there to do or be something new. It is now well-structured and established consumer culture for young designers, gathering there to create something and sharing their work each other is the first step toward the success in the world of “Ura-hara”. 
There are certain aspects in common that highlight some of the core methods used in the “Ura-Hara” movement. Everything is chosen with extreme care and attention had been paid to details. “It is not enough to wear a bracelet, it has to be coordinated with all the other elements of a look (makeup, hair, shoes) as well as with the wearer's friends' or partner's look for the day. It also has to either coordinate with the seasons or purposefully not do so.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) It was more about how you coordinate with other clothes rather than the design of clothes. The 1990s was a generation that allowed individuals to dress themselves with their own sense of feeling, such as mixing styles from the “Ura-hara” street wear brand Hysteric Glamour, with the likes of luxury brands including Chanel, DC (Designer Character) brand Comme des Garcons, instead of the brand coordinating. I believe that there should not be a rule stating that you cannot mix luxury brands with streetwear brands. These youth from the “Ura-hara” movement destroyed the boundary between the two and merged the lines of luxury and streetwear. This freedom given to “Ura-hara” was unique and it became the most diverse center of fashion in the world, as well as fashion’s melting pot. It was evident that "Ura-hara" was influenced by the streets, compared to the 1980s where luxury fashion led the market. From the perspective of young individuals interested in fashion, this concept of how to merge streetwear and luxury to coordinate outfits has gained significant interest. 
Another key aspect to understand “Ura-hara” culture can be seen in Japan's relationship with the outside world. There is a complete disconnect between what something is and what it is supposed to mean. “Punk can be cute. Micro-mini skirts aren't sexy. Ghoulish makeup isn't macabre. Hip-hop is a state of mind rather than a reference to a specific cultural experience. “ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Some people wear body piercing as personal style to express themselves, it has nothing to do with tribal culture, sexuality, or counter-culturalism. It is their pure fashion as a style.
Since the postwar rapid economic growth period, Japan has become a country more committed to shopping culture. Despite the end of the economic bubble in the 1990s, shopping culture has remained as an essential part of the lifestyle, and a particularly powerful way to represent identity among the youth. The development of youth subculture as an economic power has speed up the pace of the trend cycle and has driven the demand for street wear in Japan. “ In the scene's frenetic jump from style to style to style, there is a consistent lack of complacence - a style deficit disorder driving the relentless hunt for the new. “ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) In ”Ura-hara”, what you wear is ‘a reaction to the immediate reality of the street.’ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Trends appear and disappear constantly. “Harajuku is a headless beast that is at the mercy of its desires and restlessness.” (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) It is inevitable due to the cycle of trends, that a new one will likely emerge within a certain amount of time. The ‘laggards’ of a trend will be left behind. “Influences can appear right before you, just walking down Omotesando. There is a strange sort of democratic idolatry found there. “ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) Celebrities are not the only fashion icons, but also the designers, stylists, shop staff, hair stylists who involved with “Ura-hara” could be fashion icons. “Even the kids who buy the latest trends can have their moment in the sun. Teams of photographers from street-snap magazines like FRUiTS and TuNE are regularly stationed along Harajuku's main drag, capturing the kids and turning them, at least for an issue, into fashion celebrities and innovators. Where else can you walk down the street expecting to be scouted by camera crews? “ (Tiffany and Ivan,2008) “Ura-hara” itself is a medium that passes along information. Dressed up to walk down the streets of “Ura-Hara” and being seen on the streets is a form of communication, articulated through the photography taken for magazines past and present, such as CUTiE, FRUiTS, and the street snap magazines that followed to the world. “It can be said that the 90s fashion photography is the photography of generation where streets, that is to say, wearers, coordinators have become conspicuous.” (Higashi,1998) Therefore, photography and printed media have built a significant role as a communication tool to drive the “Ura-hara” influence. These mediums have helped the “Ura-hara” movement to gain recognition and popularity. 
The definitions of fashion photography were different in the 1980s and 1990s. During the 1980s, advertisements controlled photography within Japan. All the additional income from the bubble economy was spent on advertisements, with all of the photo shoots taking place in foreign countries where a large majority of the staff were hired due to the large budget available. However, after the crash of the rapid economic growth in the late 1980s to early 1990s, advertisements lost their significance in photography. From the beginning of 1990s, the interests toward fashion photography had been increasing. Culture had seemed to change and the focus had shifted to ‘photography, post-grunge alternative music, and street fashions.’ (Higashi,1998) It was between the years of 1993 to 1995 when this started happening. “The presence of Nobuyoshi Araki, whose works involve with "private" and "journal" like reality and the utilization of photographs with the use of artificiality, had made Tokyo into a "story" “ (Higashi,1998) I would argue that fashion photography doesn’t always have to have shots of clothing: Even when the focus is on the choice of models or locations, photography from the 1990s altered reality and shifted imagery into something more creative and focused on storytelling. This provided strong influence on young photographers and youth who had once lost interest in commercial photography. Instead of advertisements, photography offered a place for fashion and music which drove the rise in subculture magazines. Subculture magazines such as CUTiE, Smart, H, Studio Voice, Switch, positively provided a platform for young photographers to carry out their work. Both CUTiE and H looked to redefine photography by mixing it with fashion and I believe that they can be considered pioneers within this space. Arguably, with this in mind, fashion photography can be considered as the photography of the 1990s and these publications helped to shift the boundaries. 
It is interesting that the taste and style of those photographs had made appearances in other publications as a result after CUTiE had set it up. It has been argued that CUTiE’s first edition had ‘a fundamental concept of supporting "independent girls" that held up a position to oppose the 1980s DC brands.’ (Higashi,1998) Especially, when they started using stylists, such as Sonya S Park and the model, Miwako Ichikawa in 1993. Sonya S Park has taken a significant role in terms of the collaborative works she has done with Takashi Homma and other photographers that highlighted ‘how street-like nature can be expressed in fashion photography.’ (Higashi,1998) Copies of CUTiE increased dramatically, with the publication employing more young photographers. It has been argued that the magazine became the most reliable source of ‘street feeling.’ (Higashi,1998) During this period, young photographers made a statement of being a photographer as a cool style: “They began to reconsider their professions.” (Higashi,1998) and started to discover everyday objects and places they found to be "cool". Those familiar places such as ‘near by parking lots and karaoke boxes’ (Higashi,1998) would have never been considered as scenes of fashion photography before. Takashi Homma and HIROMIX also have transformed the mundane, everyday girls in Harajuku into something more vivid and more beautiful. From this point of view, it has filled the distance between fashion and photography. I believe that Takashi Homma and HIROMIX have played a crucial role within this movement. Their styles of photography are different from each other; however, they have become role models within this space for the “Ura-hara” fashion magazine readers and are undoubtedly very influential. 
While the Harajuku area has long been a spot for a domestic audience to come together and connect with western subculture and lifestyle, the influence has reversed in recent years. Since the 2000s, each of the original “Ura-hara” designers has been developing and expanding their brands, Undercover moved into women’s runway in Paris fashion week, A Bathing Ape has been growing with hip-hop culture and is gaining international recognition in the street fashion scene, especially in the U.S. Neighbourhood and Wtaps have also developed biker and military casual style with street wear elements that has gained the attention and many overseas fans. Each brand has moved away from being summarised by the term “Ura-hara” and have started to develop their own identity even outside of Japan. Additionally, Western fashion designers are now being influenced by what happened on the streets of “Ura-hara”. A lot of Japanese brands and designers are now being invited to collaborate with the Western brands and designers. 
In the 1980s Japanese creators in Tokyo had headed to New York, London, and Paris. In contrast, creators from Western cities started coming over to Tokyo in the 1990s, including Photographers, Graphic Designers, Editors and Stylists. Those foreigners with creative professions say they want to visit Tokyo. The reason is not only because of the early experiences with Japanese anime in their childhoods but their interest towards Tokyo has also been influenced by the magazines published within Japan. For example, there are some visual representations as a door to the different cultural interests in magazines such as CUTiE, that I had touched on previously. The magazines and materials published from within Tokyo have inspired these creatives in terms of the visual aspects and aesthetic, and arguably Japan has the largest magazine sections within their book stores compared to any other country.  
Especially, when it comes to zines or magazines on subcultures, people have claimed that ‘Only Japan would have them.’ However, “Ura-hara” girls are the real reasons which have been attracting people more than anything else. Tokyo girls from “Ura-hara” in the 1990s with “baby tees” have liberated themselves without having to speak out verbally or fight against anything. These individuals believed that ‘It’s important to feel good [in] myself’ (Higashi,1998) and undoubtedly their fashion and lifestyle can be viewed as being far different from previous generations, that used European style as a template to look to. Additionally, the clothes sold within “Ura-hara” were affordable and suited for small, skinny Japanese girls' bodies, making it accessible for girls to find clothes that suit them. Perhaps, movements that appeared in the early 1990s encouraged “Ura-hara” girls to be suddenly free.
While most Japanese fashion magazines were still ignoring this movement that appeared on the streets of “Ura-hara” by going after the fashion trends coming out from Western countries, CUTiE had captured the 1990s “Ura-hara” girls. As the only media without any foreign models on its editing policy, the first edition by Kyoji Takahashi, and Takashi Homma had presented works with the concept of the exclusive use of Japanese models.The photographs of Kyoji Takahashi and Takashi Homma were taken to make a statement that "Ura-hara" girls were the coolest girls.  By targeting those young girls with a slightly different style than other girls, CUTiE suddenly has become the most popular fashion magazine in Japan and they have gone beyond An-An or Ryuko Tsushin. These early adopters of the trend have driven the Ura-hara subculture’s influence wider beyond the streets of Tokyo.
Western creatives have also been influenced by “Ura-hara” in other ways. Most recently, Japanese footwear brand, Asics, and London based fashion designer Kiko Kostadinov have collaborated, as well as Kostadinov also collaborating with the Japanese fashion brands from “Ura-hara”, Hysteric Glamour. “Nothing screams the early 2000s like some skants (skirt +pants). Drenched in a co-branded print, the hybrid trousers - a staple silhouette in Kiko Kostadinov's womenswear line - lead the collection along with a matching jacket. Sleeveless knit tops with trippy stripes join graphic-mania pullovers and long sleeves tees to round off this, well, hysterically glamorous display by Nobuhiko Kitamura's brand and Kiko Kostadinov.“ (Andrea,2022) “It doesn't get more Y2K than the brands ASICS GEL-QUANTUM Lylia sneakers, which borrows elements from the GEL-Aurania and GEL-QUANTUM LEVITRACK - models Kiko Kostradinov has worked on in the past.“ (Andrea,2022)
Although the collection itself speaks of “Ura-hara” in the early 2000s, the most important aspect of this collaborative collection was a campaign, shot by British photographer Rosie Marks, starring Japanese model Kiko Mizuhara. The campaign was shot in Tokyo Japan with paparazzi-style visuals.

“The model emulates the essence of those 2000s icons whose rebellious style and demeanor we grew up idolizing.” (Andrea,2022)
The fact that this young British photographer shot an iconic Japanese model in the “Ura-Hara” region of Tokyo for the London based brand is remarkable. It seems that the campaign was successful as the photo shoot was not shot in London with British models, however the two brands returned back to Hysteric Glamour’s origin, which undoubtedly increases the authenticity of both the campaign, as well as the two brands itself. - “Ura-hara” but with a hand of Western creatives and sense of feeling.
This campaign is arguably the most successful example of Western culture influencing “Ura-hara” creators. Western creators are influenced by “Ura-hara” and now the next step of cross-fertilization is occurring. Perhaps, the future of “Ura-hara” can be seen here. Creatives from different backgrounds and cultures are influencing each other and are taking elements from each other’s heritage; Pollinating to develop a newborn trend or subculture established from anywhere.
Following on from this, I would like to explore the in-person reaction my friend and I gained from the pop up store we organised, “Boy Next Door” at Peckham London, in November 2022, that focused on vintage designer clothing and accessories that we sourced and sold, inspired by “Ura-hara”. I collected paper media such as posters, fashion and subculture magazines, and photo books from photographers who worked for those magazines from same era. The reason why we wanted to exhibit clothes and books at the same time is because we wanted visitors to read the fashion magazines to see that the clothes that we were selling were worn by people in “Ura-Hara”, as well as read articles from the 1990s when Ura-hara was in its peak. Moreover, I wanted the visitor to feel the “Ura-Hara” atmosphere and what aspects and features of Tokyo led to the emergence of the “Ura-hara” movement, displayed in the photo books and subculture magazines. 
People from different backgrounds visited our pop up store, such as designers, artists, musicians, stylists, Art students and skaters, however all seemed to have an interest in culture and came from creative backgrounds. Visitors were looking for something unique and for something that is hard to come by in London. The majority of them already knew these “Ura-hara” brands that we were selling, however some people were surprised by the detailed design and high functionality of the items. Significantly a lot of the individuals also spent a lot of time looking through the printed media. Some visitors asked me if they could purchase books, even though they were not for sale. I even decided to sell some due to high demand from the visitors. Additionally, I had a great conversation with a visitor about how “Ura-hara” is still influencing us. Some visitors asked me about specific magazines or books, and I explained the story behind them: It is clear that people still want to be influenced by “Ura-hara” and still have an interest in it. 
Although the majority of visitors were already familiar with or obsessed with “Ura-hara” subculture, it seems that they were intrigued and inspired by the creativity from “Ura-hara”. Undoubtedly “Ura-hara” is a very rich subculture, and this was successfully displayed throughout our pop up store.

Conclusion

In conclusion, it is clear that the “Ura-harajuku” subculture was established by a cross-fertilization of domestic and foreign subcultures. By taking elements of Western subcultures and editing them to create something different, the “Ura-hara” movement offered something new to Japanese youth that they had not been exposed to.The freedom given to “Ura-hara” was unique and allowed it to be the most diverse center of fashion in the world and establish itself a distinctive identity.
The subculture is clearly expressed and defined by the outfit of these youth from "Ura-hara": Enabling them a form of self-expression and using style as a tool to communicate a specific identity within a wider community. These early adopters of the "Ura-hara" style, found within these streets of "Ura-hara", were and still are the inspiration for creatives both in the 1990s and during the present day. As evidenced, “Ura-hara” is not just a physical location; it is also an environment for those youth who gathered there to do or be something new and that in itself created a wider culture. Street wear fashion, guerrilla marketing, and a limited production model have helped to develop the business model of “Ura-hara” on a vast scale. It is evident however that the "Ura-hara" subculture was influenced by the streets and this melting pot of creativity.
Additionally, "Ura-hara" has enabled creatives to produce something new and share their work both with other creatives from this district and showcase this to Western creatives. Photography and printed media have built a significant role as a communication tool to drive the “Ura-hara” influence, and have allowed the subculture to gain exposure and popularity. This in turn has enabled “Ura-hara” and its influence to impact these Western countries and creatives. The latest collaboration between Kiko Kostadinov, Hysteric Glamour and Asics demonstrate how "Ura-hara" is regaining popularity and filtering back into the fashion industry in the present day, showing how this cross-fertilization is now occurring but also how authenticity of the subculture has still been maintained.
I was able to witness first-hand that the “Ura-Hara” subculture is still influencing Western youth today and circling back into being considered as trendy: The majority of the visitors at the pop-up had a strong interest in vintage clothes and magazines that were displayed from this “Ura-hara” subculture.
It is clear that creatives from different backgrounds and cultures are influencing each other and that "Ura-hara"’s influence is significant. I believe that taking elements and inspiration from different cultures drives creativity and that "Ura-hara" itself will continue to become more diverse and be seen as something more than just a Japanese subculture or even physical location.
